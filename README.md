Hello,

Thank you for reading me. I am here to let you know of any bugs, issues, runtime
errors, or missed steps made during the process, as well as listing my sources.

Errors: None
Missed Steps/ Potential Direction changes: I was going to utilize Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability but decided instead to try a combination of the union,|, A/B to then create a conditional probability for each outcome and using the Law of Total Probability, I was going to compute an overall for them as there were two outcomes.
